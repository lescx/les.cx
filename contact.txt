I'm not on social media. I have and love Letterboxd, though.

A warning about email:

1. I fade out my usage of the lowest common denominator for communication: email. Email was never designed for security and privacy.
2. I stopped using S/MIME and PGP in Summer 2024.
3. I do support DANE, MTA-STS, DMARC, SPF etc etc, but can we please just use something not email? Thank you.

```bash
$ dig +noall +answer mx les.cx
les.cx.                 300     IN      MX      10 mail.protonmail.ch.
les.cx.                 300     IN      MX      20 mailsec.protonmail.ch.
```

Email netiquette:

1. Use plain text.
2. Donâ€™t send me spam, scam, newsletters, ads, crypto/NFT, AI or marketing SEO bullshit. This list will be updated as I see fit.
3. My inbox, my rules. If in doubt, I will put you on my blocklist.

Don't expect an answer.
